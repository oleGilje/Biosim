# BioSim U19 Herman Ole

In the BioSim project we simulate an island called Rossumøya. Rossumøya is a small island in 
the middle of the vast ocean that belongs to the island nation of Pylandia. The ecosystem on 
Rossumøya is characterized by several landscape types: Lowland, Highland and Desert. 
The fauna includes only two species, one species of herbivore and one species of carnivore. 
In our simulation we can set a chosen number of years to simulate to see how the population 
evolves. 

Rossumøyas faunas most important characteristics are: 
* **Herbivores** Depend on a good supply of fodder to survive and reproduce.
* **Carnivores** Depend on availability of prey.
* **Lowland** Provides large amounts of fodder even under intense grazing.
* **Highland** Provides a limited amount of fodder.
* **Desert** Does not provide fodder for herbivores.
* **Water** Is impassable for both species. 

In the project we have also included graphics to visualize the simulation and how it develops over
a given amount of years. 
The graphics shows:
* The map which is color coded for the different types of land. 
* A graph of how the animal count develops over time.
* Herbivores and carnivores density.
* The age, weight and fitness distribution of the animals.
